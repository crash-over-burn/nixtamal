# LLM Notes Folder

This folder is for comprehensive notes taken by AI agents after each major change to the codebase.

## Purpose
- Document learnings, insights, and decisions made during development
- Track architectural changes, bug fixes, and feature implementations
- Provide context for future agents or developers
- Maintain a knowledge base of the project's evolution

## Guidelines for Agents
- Create a new markdown file for each major change (e.g., `2025-01-07-feature-x.md`)
- Include: what was changed, why, challenges faced, solutions, and lessons learned
- Be thorough but concise; aim for 200-500 words per note
- Use consistent naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- Reference related files, commits, or issues
