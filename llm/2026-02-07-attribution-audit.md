# Documentation Attribution Audit Completion

## Summary
Completed comprehensive audit of nixtamal documentation to ensure proper attribution to toastal as the original author and project lead, maintaining voice consistency and attribution standards.

## What Was Changed
- Modified AGENTS.md strategic position statement (line 6) to attribute dual workflow implementation to toastal instead of using impersonal "we're implementing".

## Why This Change
- Ensured voice attribution requirements are met by speaking from toastal's perspective
- Maintained consistency with project's attribution standards
- Enhanced transparency and proper credit to original author

## Challenges & Solutions
No significant challenges encountered - all other documentation already properly credited toastal, requiring only a single line modification in AGENTS.md.

## Learnings
- Importance of consistent voice attribution in documentation
- Value of maintaining clear author identification across all project materials
- Benefits of regular attribution audits for open source projects
